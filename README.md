# Tempo-final-project-package-CSC-431-Spring-2024
Final project submission for team 01 (Tempo) of  CSC 431 Spring 2024 class

Project Overview:
  This project was made by Alexandr Kim, Enzo Carvalho, and Salvatore Puma. Throughout the semester, our team worked on a project called Tempo, a mobile calendar application with an AI chatbot assistant. We decided to create Tempo because all three of us share a passion for using scheduling and calendar apps to organize ourselves, and we wanted to develop a more personalized and intuitive solution that hasn't yet been made.

Working on Tempo was a fantastic experience, especially as we navigated through various project milestones. We began with the project proposal, outlining our vision and goals for Tempo. Next, we developed the Software Requirements Specifications, which helped us understand the user needs and features required for the app. Finally, we defined the System Architecture Specifications, laying the foundation for Tempo's structure and functionality.

Sal's artistic talents and front-end skills were instrumental in designing an engaging user interface and vivid presentations, while Alex and I focused more on the back-end development, ensuring the app's functionality was robust and efficient. The midterm and final presentations provided us with opportunities to showcase our progress and receive valuable feedback from our peers and instructors. Overall, working on Tempo was a fulfilling experience that allowed us to apply the knowledge and skills in software engineering we learned in class to create a practical and innovative solution. We learned a tremendous amount along the way, and are really happy to have had this experience!
